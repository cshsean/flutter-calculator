# Flutter Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app built with **Flutter**. It was created as my **first Flutter project**, and served as a hands-on way to learn the basics of Flutter, Dart syntax, UI layout, and app logic.

## âœ¨ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Parentheses support
- Simple expression evaluation logic
- Error handling (e.g. invalid syntax, divide by zero)
- Expression/result history display

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

While building this app, I explored:

- Dart fundamentals (variables, conditionals, lists, functions, etc.)
- Flutter widget tree structure
- Stateless vs Stateful widgets

- Building custom widgets and layouts
- State management within a simple app
- Parsing expressions and using postfix evaluation
- Implementation of algorithms (Shunting Yard Algorithm)


## ðŸ§  Areas for Improvement

This project is a work in progress and a learning experience. Some features or improvements I hope to add next:

- Add support for additional operations (e.g. percentage `%`)
- Refactor and clean up logic, especially around handling previous expressions/results
- Possibly integrate themes (dark/light mode toggle)
